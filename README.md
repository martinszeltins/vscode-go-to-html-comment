A quick and easy way to search and jump to HTML comments. When working with larger HTML files, it can be difficult to find specific sections of code, especially when using utility classes and not semantic classes (for example with Tailwind CSS). This extension allows you to search for HTML comments and jump to them with a single keystroke.

This extension was inspired by the `Go to Symbol...` feature but unfortunately it does not consider comments as symbols which is what this extension solves.

## Usage
This extension adds a new Command Palette option `Go to HTML comment...` (ctrl+shift+r) that displays all HTML comments found in the current file and allows searching and jumping to a specific comment.
